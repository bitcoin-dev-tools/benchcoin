Test the blocks of a peer that are processed on the connect pool during initial block download.

A block the node asked a peer for leaves the message handler thread. What the peer may rely on stays as it
was: a ping is answered only once the blocks sent before it are processed and connected, and a peer whose
block is found mutated or invalid is disconnected, with the chain left where it was.
